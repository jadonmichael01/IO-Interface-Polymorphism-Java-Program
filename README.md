# IO-Interface-Polymorphism-Java-Program
This was a programming project for my programming class in FIU.
In this project, I implemented a program that stores the user's input of personal information in a comma-separated-value
(.csv) file.
Implemented data structure, interface, and polymorphism for classes. 

User enters personal information of n students and teachers using the console in the following format:

Position1 Name1 StudentID1 TeacherID1 Phone1 Position2 Name2 StudentID2 TeacherID2 Phone2 Position3 Name3 StudentID3 TeacherID3 Phone3
