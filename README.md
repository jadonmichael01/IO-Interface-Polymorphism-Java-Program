# IO-Interface-Polymorphism-Java-Program
This was a programming project for my programming class in FIU.
In this project, I implemented a program that stores the user's input of personal information in a comma-separated-value
(.csv) file.
Implemented data structure, interface, and polymorphism for classes.
